# Schedule Feature Updates - Testing Checklist

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Two-Pass Session Distribution Strategy
- **File Modified**: `/lib/scheduling/optimized-scheduler.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Modified `findStudentSlots` to use two-pass distribution
  - First pass: Limits sessions to 3 per time slot for even distribution
  - Second pass: Allows up to 6 sessions per slot if needed
  - Added `findSlotsWithCapacityLimit` helper method

### 2. Grade Level Grouping Optimization
- **Files Modified**: `/lib/scheduling/optimized-scheduler.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `studentGradeMap` to `SchedulingContext` interface
  - Populated grade map in `scheduleBatch` method
  - Added `sortSlotsWithGradePreference` method
  - Prioritizes slots with same grade level (secondary to even distribution)

### 3. Manual Drag-and-Drop Conflict Warnings
- **File Modified**: `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/schedule/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `checkSlotConflicts` to collect all conflicts
  - Changed `handleDrop` to show confirmation dialog with detailed conflicts
  - Users can now override conflicts after confirmation
  - Specific warning messages for each type of conflict

### 4. Fixed Drag-and-Drop Positioning
- **File Modified**: `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/schedule/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `dragOffset` state to track click position within session block
  - Modified `handleDragStart` to capture offset
  - Modified `handleDragOver` to adjust position using offset
  - Session now drops exactly where the ghost preview shows

## Testing Checklist

### Two-Pass Distribution Testing
- [ ] Schedule multiple students with varying session requirements
- [ ] Verify first pass distributes sessions evenly (max 3 per slot)
- [ ] Verify second pass fills remaining slots (up to 6 per slot)
- [ ] Check console logs for "FIRST PASS" and "SECOND PASS" messages
- [ ] Confirm no sessions scheduled in morning hours unnecessarily
- [ ] Test with students requiring many sessions (e.g., 5 sessions/week)

### Grade Level Grouping Testing
- [ ] Schedule students from same grade level
- [ ] Verify they tend to be grouped in same time slots when possible
- [ ] Confirm even distribution takes priority over grade grouping
- [ ] Test with mixed grade levels
- [ ] Verify constraints are never violated for grade grouping

### Drag-and-Drop Conflict Warning Testing
- [ ] Drag session to time outside school hours
  - Should see: "Session outside school hours" warning
- [ ] Drag session to bell schedule conflict
  - Should see: "Conflicts with bell schedule: [period name]" warning
- [ ] Drag session to special activity conflict
  - Should see: "Conflicts with special activity: [activity name]" warning
- [ ] Drag session where student already has session
  - Should see: "Overlaps with another session" warning
- [ ] Drag session to full slot (6 sessions)
  - Should see: "Time slot is at capacity" warning
- [ ] Test multiple conflicts at once
  - Should see all applicable warnings listed
- [ ] Test confirming and canceling conflict placement
- [ ] Verify session moves only when confirmed

### Drag-and-Drop Positioning Testing
- [ ] Drag session by grabbing from top - verify drops at cursor position
- [ ] Drag session by grabbing from middle - verify drops at cursor position
- [ ] Drag session by grabbing from bottom - verify drops at cursor position
- [ ] Verify ghost preview and actual drop position match exactly
- [ ] Test with different session durations (30min, 60min, etc.)
- [ ] Test dragging between different days
- [ ] Test snap-to-grid functionality (5-minute intervals)

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Existing scheduling features still work
- [ ] Bell schedule constraints respected
- [ ] Special activity constraints respected
- [ ] Provider work schedule constraints respected
- [ ] School hours constraints respected
- [ ] Consecutive session rules (max 60 min) enforced
- [ ] Break requirements (30 min) enforced
- [ ] Session capacity limits enforced
- [ ] No performance degradation

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Schedule with no available slots
- [ ] Schedule with very limited availability
- [ ] Drag session to same position (no-op)
- [ ] Multiple users scheduling simultaneously
- [ ] Browser refresh during scheduling
- [ ] Network errors during drag-and-drop

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor console for excessive logging
- Check for smooth drag-and-drop operations
- Verify no lag when scheduling many students
- Ensure UI updates are immediate (optimistic updates)

## Known Limitations
- Grade grouping is "best effort" - will not override constraints
- Maximum 6 sessions per time slot (hard limit)
- Drag-and-drop requires manual confirmation for conflicts
