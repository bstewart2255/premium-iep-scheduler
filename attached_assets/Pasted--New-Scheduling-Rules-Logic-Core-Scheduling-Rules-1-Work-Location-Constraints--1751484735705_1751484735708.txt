## New Scheduling Rules & Logic

### Core Scheduling Rules

#### 1. **Work Location Constraints**
- **Rule**: Sessions can ONLY be scheduled on days when the provider works at that specific school
- **Implementation**: Check `user_site_schedules` table for provider availability at each school
- **Example**: If provider works at Bancroft on Mon/Tue, no Bancroft student sessions on Wed/Thu/Fri

#### 2. **Session Distribution**
- **Rule**: No limit on sessions per day (removed old one-per-day restriction)
- **Preference**: For students with 3+ sessions, TRY to distribute across multiple days when possible
- **Implementation**: Sort days by existing session count, attempt distribution in first pass

#### 3. **Concurrent Session Limit**
- **Rule**: Maximum 6 sessions can occur at the same time (increased from 4)
- **Implementation**: Check slot capacity before scheduling

#### 4. **Consecutive Session Rules**
- **Rule**: Maximum 60 consecutive minutes without a break
- **Example**: Can have 2x30min back-to-back, but not 3x30min
- **Implementation**: Check total consecutive time when validating slots

#### 5. **Break Requirements**
- **Rule**: Minimum 30-minute break between non-consecutive sessions
- **Example**: If session ends at 9:00, next session can't start until 9:30 (unless back-to-back)
- **Implementation**: Calculate gap between sessions, require ≥30 min if not consecutive

#### 6. **School Hours**
- **Rule**: All sessions must end by 3:00 PM (15:00)
- **Implementation**: Validate end time ≤ 15:00

#### 7. **Bell Schedule Conflicts**
- **Rule**: No sessions during bell schedule periods for student's grade
- **Implementation**: Check bell schedules by grade level and day

#### 8. **Special Activities**
- **Rule**: No sessions during teacher's special activities
- **Implementation**: Check special activities by teacher name and day

### Removed Rules
1. ~~One session per student per day~~ ❌
2. ~~Daily minute cap (was 120 minutes)~~ ❌
3. ~~4 concurrent session limit~~ ❌ (now 6)

### Scheduling Priority Order
1. Students with more sessions needed (harder to schedule)
2. Distribute across available days when possible
3. Fill morning slots before afternoon
4. Respect all constraints above

### Edge Cases to Handle
- If insufficient slots due to constraints, schedule as many as possible
- If provider has no defined work schedule, assume all weekdays available
- Grade levels in bell schedules can be comma-separated (e.g., "1,2,3")
